# Selection

These programs are examples of using conditional (`if`) statements for selection.

Some of these programs introduce some error-checking. So numeric values are checked
for sanity, for example. This is LBYL ("Look Before You Leap") checking. There is no checking that
a number is actually entered, because that is significantly easier with EAFP ("Easier to Ask Forgiveness
than Permission"). Those examples are in a different folder.
