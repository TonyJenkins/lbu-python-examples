# Reading Values

Most of these programs are from the _Basic Maths_ folder, but are modified to read their input
values from the user.

_There is no error checking in these programs, so they will crash if, for example, the users
enters letters when a number is expected. They also do not check the input values for "sanity", so,
for example, negative numbers are allowed where this makes no sense._
