# Repetition

After _sequence_ and _selection_, here is _repetition_.

There are two types of repetition in programs. They could be both coded the same way, but usually
for covenience there are different ways. Below are examples of both, viz:

- _determinate_ repetition, where it can be known before the loop starts how many executions there will be. These are
first below.
- _indeterminate_ repetition, where the number of executions cannot be known before the loop starts.

_Note: Some of these programs could be neater with the use of lists. See the next section along for examples
of that._

_Another Note: For clarity, some of the error-checking introduced in the previous two sections has been left out in
some of these examples._

## Contents

Using determinate (`for`) loops:

- `countdown.py` - Display an (exciting) space rocket countdown.
- `grade_average.py` - Determine a student's average grade based on _five_ entered marks. (No error checking.)
- `grade_passes.py` - Count passed modules, where a student needs to pass 5 of 6, and display the result. (No error checking.)
- `password_check.py` - Check whether a password contains an uppercase letter, lowercase letter, special character, and digit.
- `table_of_times_tables.py` - Display the first 12 "times tables", as taught to school children.
- `times_table.py` - Display an arbitrary "times table". (No error checking.)

Using indeterminate (`while`) loops:

- `mark_average.py` - Determine a student's average grade based on an arbitrary number of marks. (Some error checking.)
- `password_changer.py` - The password complexity program above, but repeating until the password is OK.
- `password_checker.py` - Check two entered passwords match, exiting if they do, but with only three attempts.
