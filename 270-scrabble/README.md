# Scrabble

Scrabble (tm) is a word board game. Players make letters from 
their rack of (usually) seven tiles. Each tile bears one letter.

Letters score differently depending on their frequency of use.

This folder contains code that would be useful in similating a
Scrabble game. There are classes, and a module of functions (the
classes use functions from the module).

The program `scrabble_solo.py` simulates a single-player game where
the user always plays their best word. (Obviously we are ignoring
issues of actually playing the word on a board.)
