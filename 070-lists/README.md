# Lists

Lists are a _compund data type_. They contain multiple values. Usually, these are values
of the same type (you can even have a list of lists). For collections of values of
different types (for example  representing some customer details), see `tuples` in the
next section.

The programs here illustrate some uses of lists. (Some are refactoring of previous example 
programs.) Lists are so common that many of the longer examples use _a lot_ of lists.

Many of these programs also use modules from the Standard Library, for example to read
the names of the files in the current folder.

## Contents
