# Dictionaries, Tuples, and Sets

Often the "trick" in writing an efficient program is picking the right
way to store the data. These programs illustrate how to use the remaining
three data structures provided in Python.

You _can_ do everything with lists, but sometimes great advantage can be 
gained from using something else.

## Contents

Dictionaries:

- `capitals.py` - A very simple quiz program.
- `class_list.py` - Read student names and grades, and print class list in grade order.
- `file_types.py` - List the files in the current folder and their assumed type (based on name).
- `nato.py` - Render a string in the NATO phonetic alphabet.

Tuples:

Sets:

- `random_list.py` - Generate a list of unique random numbers.
- `unique_scores.py` - Find the unique numbers in a _list_.
