# A Banking App

This is a simple banking app that allows users to create accounts, deposit and withdraw money, 
and check their balance. It is built using Python and SQLite.

It should be self-explanatory. It could form the basis of a more complex banking application,
but for now it is a simple example of how to use Python and SQLite to create a banking app.

_The above is according to GitHub Coplilot, not me!_
