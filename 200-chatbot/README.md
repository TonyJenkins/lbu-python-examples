# LBU Chatbot

A simple "Chatbot", with absolutely no AI, originally created for Open Days.

Settings are stored in a JSON file, which is loaded when the program starts.

It is very, very simple. And quite random. Dissect the code to see how it
works. Or, if brave, run it and see if you can work it out.
