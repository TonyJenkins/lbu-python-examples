# lbu-python-examples

This repo contains various sample Python programs.

They are arranged in directories by topic. The numbers in the directory names
indicate (very roughly) the order in which they could be read. So "higher numbers"
may well use additional Python features.

The should be an index file in each directory, which gives a brief idea of what each
program does.

_The idea here is that one way to learn programming is to read and understand existing
programs. Maybe that's true?_

The programs are provided "as is" and without any warranty. They are not intended to be production
quality code, but rather to illustrate various Python features and techniques. Some of them may
well be borked, or may omit error hendling for clarity. Caveat emptor!
