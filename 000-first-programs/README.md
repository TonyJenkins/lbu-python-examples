# The First Programs

The first two programs that anyone learn to write are always the same. The first prints a 
cheery greeting to the screen, and the second extends this to include the user's name.

_These programs show basic output to the screen, and how to read a string from the user. The string
is stored in a variable, and then displayed back in the message._

## Contents

- `hello_world.py` - The canonical "Hello, World!" program.
- `hello_name.py` - A program that greets the user by name, using an _f-string_.
