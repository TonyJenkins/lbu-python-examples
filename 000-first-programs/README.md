# The First Programs

The first two programs that anyone learn to write are always the same. The first prints a 
cheery greeting to the screen, and the second extends this to include the user's name.

_These programs show basic output to the screen, and how to read a string from the user. The string
is stored in a variable, and then displayed back in the message._

The third program presents something of a choice. The version here prompts the user to enter
the current year, and the year of their birth. It then calculates the user's age (or, at least,
their age this birthday) and displays it. This program adds in reading an integer, and some
very basic maths.

2. `hello_name.py` - A program that greets the user by name, using an _f-string_.
3. `hello_age.py` - A possible third program, about birthdays.
