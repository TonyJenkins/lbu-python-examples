# HILO Game

A simple game where the computer "thinks" of a random number between 0 and 100,
and then asks the user to guess.

The user has 10 attempts to get the number correct. The program does not count
guesses if the user has already guessed a number.

_Note: There is a small amount of cunning in choosing the number, given that
a sensible user will adopt a "Binary Search" approach and start at 50!_
